# DS Prod Profile

- Write basic tests for the main functionality before implementing it.
- Do not proceed with any changes until critical tests pass.
- If tests fail, investigate and either 1. fix the code or 2. fix.remove tests if they are incorrect/redundant. Never ignore failing tests or modify tests to make them pass without understanding the root cause.
